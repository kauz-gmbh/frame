      <h2>What is Frame?</h2>

      <p>
        Frame is a simple tool for adding borders to images without cropping.
        Everything runs in your browser.
      </p>

      <p>
        Frame was inspired by <a href="https://padsnap.app/">PadSnap</a> and
        tries to iterate on it using the
        <a href="https://brutalist.systems/">brutalist.systems</a> concept. My
        goal is to build software that brings a bit of joy to people. Frame preserves your image quality (up to 4096px)
        and your privacy. Once loaded, it works offline.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are no ads, no artificial limits, no dark patterns, and no
        monetization.
      </p>

      <h2>Usage</h2>
      <p>
        Drag images onto the page or click to select. Frame supports HEIC
        files from iPhones and will convert them automatically.
      </p>

      <h3>Options</h3>
      <p>
        The <b>aspect ratio</b> dropdown is organized by orientation. If
        you're posting to Instagram, 1:1 or 4:5 works well. For presentations
        or YouTube, try 16:9. The classic photo formats (3:2, 2:3) match what
        most cameras shoot and what prints expect. Your image gets centered
        and scaled to fit whatever ratio you pick.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Borders</b> can go from 0 to 200 pixels. 50-100px gives a lovely
        gallery feel without overwhelming the image. The preset buttons are
        there because dragging the slider gets tedious when you know what you
        want.
      </p>

      <p>
        For <b>backgrounds</b>, you have two options. Solid color is clean and
        classic - black for that museum wall look, white for prints, or match
        your brand colors. The blur option stretches your image to fill the
        frame and blurs it, which works nicely when the border color would
        clash with your photo. Adjust the blur amount until it looks right to
        you.
      </p>
